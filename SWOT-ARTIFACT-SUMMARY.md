## ðŸŽ¯ Key Innovation: SWOT + TOWS Hybrid

### **The Problem with Traditional SWOT:**
- Ends with lists, not actions
- Generic prompts don't elicit deep SA-specific insights
- Negative language ("Weaknesses," "Threats") demotivates entrepreneurs
- No connection between diagnosis and strategy

### **Our Solution:**
- **Guided Questions** break down abstract concepts into concrete, relatable components
- **SA-Specific Prompts** address documented SMME challenges (70-80% failure rate)
- **TOWS Matrix** generates 4 strategy types:
  - **SO (Maxi-Maxi):** Attack - Use Strengths to maximize Opportunities
  - **ST (Maxi-Mini):** Defend - Use Strengths to minimize Threats
  - **WO (Mini-Maxi):** Improve - Use Opportunities to overcome Weaknesses
  - **WT (Mini-Mini):** Survive - Minimize Weaknesses to avoid Threats

## ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ SA-Specific Guided Questions

### **Strengths:**
- "What do your customers consistently compliment you on?"
- "What specific skill, resource, or knowledge do you have that competitors don't?"
- "Do you have a Level 1 B-BBEE score? Strong local supply chain?"

### **Weaknesses:**
- "How many hours/sales did you lose to loadshedding last month?"
- "Do you use a formal system to track income and expenses? If not, what's holding you back?"

### **Opportunities:**
- "Are there affordable digital tools you could use? (e.g., Yoco, iKhokha)"
- "Are you aware of funding from SEDA, DTI, or IDC? Could you benefit?"

### **Threats:**
- "How do crime rates impact your hours, staff safety, or insurance costs?"
- "How does rising cost of fuel, electricity, or raw materials affect profitability?"

## ðŸ’¡ Example: Sourdough Sanctuary (Cape Town Bakery)

### **SWOT:**
- **S:** Loyal customer base, unique 72-hour fermentation process
- **W:** Limited online presence, reliant on one key baker
- **O:** Growing demand for artisanal food, local markets popular
- **T:** Rising flour costs, loadshedding disrupts baking schedule

### **TOWS Strategies:**
- **SO (Attack):** Create "Sourdough of the Month" club for loyal customers at local markets
- **ST (Defend):** Launch pre-order system to manage baking during loadshedding
- **WO (Improve):** Build simple online store (Shopify Lite) to fix weak online presence
- **WT (Survive):** Train 2nd baker and explore long-term flour contracts
