This self-assessment tool helps you identify your strengths and gaps across 5 critical business capabilities:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial Management - Cash flow, pricing, bookkeeping
2Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Planning - Vision, goal-setting, market analysis
3Ô∏è‚É£ Leadership & People - Team management, delegation, culture
4Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing & Sales - Customer acquisition, branding, digital presence
5Ô∏è‚É£ Operations & Technology - Processes, efficiency, digital tools

HOW IT WORKS:
‚Ä¢ Each capability area has 10 scenario-based questions
‚Ä¢ Read each scenario carefully - they're based on real SA SMME situations
‚Ä¢ Choose the response that best matches what YOU would do
‚Ä¢ Be honest! This is for YOUR benefit, not a test
‚Ä¢ Your scores will automatically calculate in the Dashboard tab

SCORING:
‚Ä¢ 0-3 points = Needs Urgent Attention (Red)
‚Ä¢ 4-6 points = Developing (Yellow)
‚Ä¢ 7-8 points = Competent (Light Green)
‚Ä¢ 9-10 points = Strong (Dark Green)

TIME: 20-30 minutes to complete all 50 questions

START: Go to the "1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial" tab and begin!
