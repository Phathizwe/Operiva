# Operiva vs. Info-Tech: Detailed Comparison & Gap Analysis

## Package Structure Comparison

| Element | Info-Tech GTM Blueprint | Operiva Market Entry Playbook | Gap/Opportunity |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Executive Brief** | ✅ 19-slide PowerPoint | ✅ 9-slide README PowerPoint | Operiva is more concise (good for SMMEs) |
| **Implementation Guide** | ✅ 96-slide PowerPoint | ✅ 25-page PDF Guide | Info-Tech uses PPT, we use PDF. Consider adding PPT version. |
| **Presentation Template** | ✅ Separate file (5 MB) | ✅ Included (04-Presentation.pptx) | Similar approach ✅ |
| **Main Workbook** | ✅ RACI & Launch Checklist (423 KB) | ✅ 7-tab comprehensive worksheet (13 KB) | Operiva is more compact |
| **Specialized Calculator 1** | ✅ Market Opportunity Sizing (703 KB) | ❌ Included in main workbook | **GAP**: Should split into separate file |
| **Specialized Calculator 2** | ✅ Cost Budget & Revenue Forecast (1.4 MB) | ❌ Included in main workbook | **GAP**: Should split into separate file |
| **Total Files** | 6 files | 4 files | Info-Tech has more specialized tools |
| **Total Package Size** | ~23 MB | 353 KB | Info-Tech has richer media/examples |

### Key Insight
Info-Tech separates financial calculators into standalone files, making them feel like distinct value-adds. Operiva bundles everything into one worksheet, which is efficient but may undervalue the content.

**Recommendation**: For premium artifacts, create 6-file packages:
1. README PowerPoint (overview)
2. Implementation Guide PowerPoint (detailed methodology)
3. Presentation Template PowerPoint (stakeholder communication)
4. Main Workbook Excel (checklists and planning)
5. Calculator 1 Excel (specialized tool)
6. Calculator 2 Excel (financial modeling)

## Content Depth Comparison

| Metric | Info-Tech | Operiva | Analysis |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Executive Brief Length** | 19 slides | 9 slides | Info-Tech provides more context and case studies |
| **Implementation Guide Length** | 96 slides | 25 pages | Info-Tech is 4x more detailed |
| **Worksheet Tabs** | 1-2 tabs per file | 7 tabs in one file | Operiva is more comprehensive per file |
| **Visual Diagrams** | Extensive (every 2-3 slides) | Moderate (key concepts only) | Info-Tech has more visual variety |
| **Examples/Case Studies** | Multiple per section | 1-2 per artifact | **GAP**: Need more SA SMME examples |
| **Templates Included** | Separate presentation file | Included in main presentation | Similar approach |

### Key Insight
Info-Tech prioritizes **depth over breadth** - each blueprint is exhaustive. Operiva prioritizes **breadth and accessibility** - covering more ground with less detail per artifact.

**Strategic Choice**: 
- **Info-Tech approach**: Fewer artifacts, but each is a comprehensive "course"
- **Operiva approach**: More artifacts, each is a focused "tool"

Both are valid. For Operiva's SMME audience, our approach is better (quick wins, less overwhelm). But we can add depth to premium artifacts.
