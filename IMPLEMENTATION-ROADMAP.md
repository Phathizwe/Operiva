## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Framework grid is too complex for mobile users
**Mitigation**: Fall back to list view on mobile, test with real users

**Risk**: Performance issues with 70+ artifacts in grid
**Mitigation**: Implement virtualization, lazy loading, code splitting

**Risk**: Search accuracy is poor
**Mitigation**: Use proven library (Fuse.js), tune search weights, add synonyms

### Content Risks

**Risk**: Can't create 30+ new artifacts in 6 weeks
**Mitigation**: Prioritize high-impact artifacts, hire freelance content creators

**Risk**: Case study participants drop out
**Mitigation**: Identify 15 candidates for 5 case studies, offer incentives

**Risk**: Blog content doesn't rank in Google
**Mitigation**: Hire SEO specialist, target long-tail keywords, build backlinks

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Users don't adopt framework grid view
**Mitigation**: A/B test, gather feedback, iterate on design

**Risk**: Premium artifacts don't drive conversions
**Mitigation**: Offer free trials, create comparison table, add testimonials

**Risk**: Churn rate is too high
**Mitigation**: Implement onboarding flow, send re-engagement emails, improve content quality

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Review and approve this roadmap** with stakeholders
2. **Prioritize phases** based on resources and business goals
3. **Assign owners** to each phase and task
4. **Set up project management** (Trello, Asana, or Notion)
5. **Begin Phase 1** (Quick Wins) immediately

### Decision Points

**Decision 1**: Do we build the framework grid in-house or hire a contractor?
**Recommendation**: In-house (more control, faster iteration)

**Decision 2**: Do we create 30+ new artifacts or focus on enhancing existing ones?
**Recommendation**: Balance both (10 new + enhance 10 existing)

**Decision 3**: Do we launch framework grid as beta or wait for full polish?
**Recommendation**: Launch as beta, gather feedback, iterate

## Conclusion

Info-Tech's periodic table framework is a proven pattern for organizing and presenting complex content. By adopting this approach while maintaining Operiva's unique strengths (SA context, SMME focus, affordable pricing, practical frameworks), we can significantly elevate the platform's credibility, usability, and value proposition.

The key is to **start small** (Phase 1 Quick Wins), **validate with users** (Framework Grid MVP), and **scale systematically** (Content Expansion, Premium Enhancement, Platform Features).

**Estimated Timeline**: 6 months
**Estimated Investment**: R80K - R160K
**Expected ROI**: 2-3x increase in user engagement, 5-10x increase in MRR

**Next Action**: Review this roadmap and schedule a planning session to kick off Phase 1.
