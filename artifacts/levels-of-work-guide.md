## 1. Introduction: The Challenge of Organizational Structure

For many Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMMEs) in South Africa, growth brings a common challenge: the **owner-manager bottleneck**. As the business expands, the founder often becomes overwhelmed, juggling operational tasks, strategic decisions, and everything in between. This leads to inefficiency, burnout, and stalled growth.

The solution lies in creating a clear, effective organizational structure that allows for delegation, accountability, and scalable growth. However, traditional organograms often fail because they are disconnected from the actual work that creates value.

This guide introduces the **Levels of Work framework**, a powerful methodology for designing an organizational structure that is organically tied to your business model and value proposition. By understanding and applying these principles, you can build a resilient, efficient, and scalable organization.

## 2. The Levels of Work Framework

The Levels of Work framework, based on the work of organizational theorist **Elliott Jaques**, categorizes work into distinct levels of complexity and time span of discretion. For SMMEs, we can simplify this into four core levels:

| Level | Title | Core Function | Time Horizon | Key Question |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **1** | **Added Value** | **Do** | Up to 3 months | "What do I need to do now?" |
| **2** | **Coordinates Value** | **Supervise** | 3-12 months | "Are we doing things right?" |
| **3** | **Controls Value** | **Manage** | 1-2 years | "How can we do things better?" |
| **4** | **Decides Value** | **Strategize** | 2-5 years | "What should we be doing next?" |

### **Level 1: Added Value (Do)**

This is the operational frontline of your business. These are the employees who directly create and deliver the value your customers pay for. Their work is concrete, tangible, and has a relatively short time horizon.

**Examples:**
- A developer writing code
- A craftsman building furniture
- A driver delivering goods
- A cashier processing sales

### **Level 2: Coordinates Value (Supervise)**

As the number of Level 1 employees grows, you need someone to coordinate their work. This is the first level of management, responsible for supervising day-to-day activities, assigning tasks, and ensuring the team works together effectively.

**Examples:**
- A shift supervisor in a factory
- A team lead in a software development team
- A head chef in a restaurant

### **Level 3: Controls Value (Manage)**

This level is about managing the systems and processes that enable the first two levels to function efficiently. They are not just supervising people; they are improving the systems, managing budgets, and ensuring quality control.

**Examples:**
- An accountant managing financial systems
- An operations manager improving production processes
- A marketing manager optimizing campaigns

### **Level 4: Decides Value (Strategize)**

This is the highest level, responsible for the long-term vision and strategic direction of the company. They are not involved in day-to-day operations but are focused on where the business is going, what new markets to enter, and how to maintain a competitive advantage.

**Examples:**
- The founder or CEO
- A board of directors
- A strategic planning committee

## 3. How to Build Your Organogram with Levels of Work

### **Step 1: Define Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

Start with your Business Model Canvas. What is the core value you promise to your customers? This is your USP.

**Example:** A custom furniture business might have the USP:
> "Exact height and weight furniture, delivered and assembled in under a week!"

### **Step 2: Map Your Key Activities to Level 1**

Break down your USP into the core activities required to deliver it. These are your Level 1 roles.

**Example (Custom Furniture):**
- Take customer measurements
- Design the furniture
- Build the furniture
- Deliver the furniture
- Assemble the furniture

Each of these activities can be a distinct role or combined into a few roles at Level 1.

### **Step 3: Add Level 2 Coordination**

As you add more Level 1 employees, who will coordinate them? This is your first supervisor.

**Example:**
- A **Workshop Supervisor** to coordinate the design and building of furniture.
- A **Logistics Coordinator** to manage deliveries and assemblies.

### **Step 4: Add Level 3 Control Systems**

What systems are needed to support the operations? These are your Level 3 roles.

**Example:**
- An **Accountant** to manage invoicing, payroll, and financial reporting.
- A **Sales & Marketing Manager** to manage pricing, promotions, and customer acquisition.

### **Step 5: Define Level 4 Strategy**

Finally, who is responsible for the overall strategy and vision? This is your Level 4 role.

**Example:**
- The **Founder/CEO** who decides on new product lines, market expansion, and long-term partnerships.

### **Step 6: Draw the Organogram**

Now, you can draw the organogram based on these levels. It will naturally reflect how your business creates value, rather than being an arbitrary hierarchy.
