## Introduction

Welcome to the **Capability Compass** - a self-assessment tool designed specifically for South African SMME owner-managers. This tool helps you identify your strengths and development areas across the five critical capabilities that determine business success.

### The Challenge

Research shows that **70-80% of South African SMMEs fail within their first 5 years**. The primary reason? Capability gaps in the owner-manager. Traditional business assessment tools are designed for corporates - they're text-heavy, culturally misaligned, and fail to account for the unique realities of running an SMME in South Africa.

### The Solution

The Capability Compass uses **scenario-based assessment** - real situations that SA SMME owners face daily. Instead of abstract questions, you'll respond to practical scenarios like:

- "It's month-end and you don't have cash to pay suppliers. What do you do?"
- "Load shedding is affecting your business. How do you respond?"
- "A competitor drops prices by 20%. What's your strategy?"

Your responses reveal your actual capabilities, not just theoretical knowledge.

## Why Self-Assessment Matters

### The Owner-Manager Reality

As an SMME owner in South Africa, you wear many hats:
- **Financial Manager** (cash flow, pricing, bookkeeping)
- **Strategist** (planning, market analysis, pivoting)
- **Leader** (team management, culture, delegation)
- **Marketer** (customer acquisition, branding, digital presence)
- **Operations Manager** (processes, efficiency, technology)

**The problem**: Most owners are strong in 1-2 areas but have blind spots in others. These blind spots become fatal weaknesses.

### Benefits of Self-Assessment

1. **Self-Awareness**: Identify your strengths and gaps objectively
2. **Prioritization**: Focus development efforts where they matter most
3. **Targeted Learning**: Access relevant Operiva artifacts for your specific needs
4. **Progress Tracking**: Retake the assessment every 6 months to measure growth
5. **Confidence**: Know where you stand and what to improve

## The 5 Capability Areas

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial Management

**Why It Matters**: Poor financial management is the #1 cause of SMME failure. You can have great products, loyal customers, and a hardworking team - but if cash runs out, the business dies.

**What We Assess**:
- Cash flow forecasting and management
- Pricing strategies (cost-plus vs value-based)
- Bookkeeping and financial reporting
- Credit management (debtors and creditors)
- Understanding financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet)
- VAT compliance and tax planning
- Separating business and personal finances

**Red Flags**:
- "I don't know my profit margin"
- "I just check my bank balance to see how I'm doing"
- "Bookkeeping is 3+ months behind"
- "I use business money for personal expenses"

**SA-Specific Considerations**:
- Load shedding impact on cash flow (backup power costs)
- High cost of credit (interest rates 15-25%)
- Informal economy dynamics (cash-based transactions)
- Access to SEFA/sefa funding

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Planning & Vision

**Why It Matters**: Without a clear strategy, you're just reacting to events. Strategic thinking helps you anticipate changes, seize opportunities, and build resilience.

**What We Assess**:
- Business planning and goal-setting
- Market analysis and competitor intelligence
- SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- Adaptability and pivoting
- Risk management
- Vision communication
- Partnership strategy

**Red Flags**:
- "I don't have a business plan - it's all in my head"
- "I haven't updated my plan in 3+ years"
- "I don't know who my competitors are"
- "I'll deal with problems when they happen"

**SA-Specific Considerations**:
- Load shedding continuity planning
- Economic volatility (rand fluctuations, inflation)
- B-BBEE and transformation requirements
- Township vs suburban market dynamics

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Leadership & People Management

**Why It Matters**: Your business can only grow as far as your leadership capability. Poor people management leads to high turnover, low productivity, and burnout.

**What We Assess**:
- Delegation and time management
- Conflict resolution
- Performance management
- Team motivation and culture
- Hiring and onboarding
- Feedback and communication
- Succession planning
- Training and development

**Red Flags**:
- "I work 70+ hours a week - no one can do it like me"
- "I only give feedback when someone messes up"
- "I hire family members to save money"
- "If I couldn't work for 3 months, the business would collapse"

**SA-Specific Considerations**:
- Labour law compliance (CCMA, UIF, COIDA)
- Skills shortage in certain sectors
- Multi-lingual team management (11 official languages)
- Informal vs formal employment

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing & Sales

**Why It Matters**: No customers = no business. Marketing isn't optional - it's how you attract, convert, and retain customers profitably.

**What We Assess**:
- Customer acquisition strategies
- Value proposition and differentiation
- Customer retention and loyalty
- Social media and digital marketing
- Branding consistency
- Sales process and pipeline management
- Customer feedback loops
- Market segmentation

**Red Flags**:
- "I rely only on word-of-mouth"
- "I don't know why customers choose me over competitors"
- "I post on social media randomly when I remember"
- "I don't have a marketing budget"

**SA-Specific Considerations**:
- WhatsApp marketing (most accessible platform)
- Data costs (barrier to digital marketing)
- LSM targeting (Living Standards Measure)
- Stokvels and community-based marketing

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Operations & Technology

**Why It Matters**: Efficient operations free up time for strategy and growth. Technology adoption is no longer optional - it's a competitive advantage.

**What We Assess**:
- Process documentation and standardization
- Quality control systems
- Inventory/stock management
- Technology adoption (accounting software, CRM, digital payments)
- Supplier relationship management
- Continuous improvement mindset
- Data security and POPIA compliance
- Automation of repetitive tasks

**Red Flags**:
- "All our processes are in my head"
- "I use pen and paper for everything"
- "I don't back up business data"
- "I order stock when I run out"

**SA-Specific Considerations**:
- Mobile-first technology (most owners use smartphones)
- Affordable SaaS tools (Yoco, Xero, Zoho)
- Load shedding backup systems
- POPIA compliance (Protection of Personal Information Act)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How often should I retake this assessment?

**A**: Every **6 months**. This allows enough time to implement changes and see measurable improvement. Track your scores over time to see your growth trajectory.

### Q: What if I score low across all areas?

**A**: Don't panic. Awareness is the first step. Prioritize:
1. **Financial management first** (non-negotiable for survival)
2. **One other area** based on your business needs
3. Seek mentorship or coaching for structured support

Consider joining a business development program (SEDA, sefa, NYDA) for comprehensive support.

### Q: Can I use this for my team?

**A**: Yes! If you have managers or key staff, have them complete it too. Compare results to identify:
- Skills gaps in your team
- Training needs
- Succession planning opportunities

### Q: What if I disagree with my score?

**A**: Scores are based on best practices, not personal opinion. If you scored low but believe you're doing well, consider:
- Are you confusing activity with effectiveness?
- Are you measuring results objectively?
- Would a mentor or peer agree with your self-assessment?

Seek external feedback to validate your self-perception.

### Q: Is this assessment confidential?

**A**: Yes. This is a self-assessment tool - your results are yours alone. Operiva does not collect or store your responses.

### Q: What's the difference between this and a business health check?

**A**: This assesses **your capabilities** as an owner-manager. A business health check assesses **the business itself** (financials, operations, market position). Both are valuable and complementary.
