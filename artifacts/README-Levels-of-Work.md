## 🎯 What is the Levels of Work Framework?

The Levels of Work framework helps you design an organizational structure that is naturally aligned with how your business creates value. Instead of arbitrary hierarchies, you build your organogram based on four distinct levels of work complexity:

| Level | Title | Core Function | Example Roles |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **1** | **Added Value** | **Do** | Craftsman, Driver, Designer |
| **2** | **Coordinates Value** | **Supervise** | Team Lead, Supervisor |
| **3** | **Controls Value** | **Manage** | Accountant, Operations Manager |
| **4** | **Decides Value** | **Strategize** | CEO, Founder |
