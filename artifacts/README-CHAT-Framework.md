## ðŸŽ¯ What is CHAT?

CHAT is a business model visualization tool based on **Activity Theory**, developed by researchers Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and EngestrÃ¶m. It helps you understand how your business creates value through 7 interconnected components.

### **The 7 Components:**

1. **Subject** - Who are you? (Your business, team, values)
2. **Object** - What do you have? (Assets, resources)
3. **Outcome** - What do you produce? (Products/services)
4. **Differentiator** - What makes you unique? (Secret sauce)
5. **Barriers to Entry** - What protects you? (Competitive advantages)
6. **Customer** - Who do you serve? (User, payer, community)
7. **Key Activities** - How do you do it? (Division of labor)
