# Cash Flow Forecasting Guide for SA SMMEs
## Master Your Cash Flow, Master Your Business

**Version 1.0 | Operiva**

---

## Introduction

**Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business.** You can be profitable on paper but still run out of cash to pay suppliers, staff, or rent. In fact, **82% of small businesses fail due to cash flow problems**, not lack of profit.

This guide teaches you how to forecast your cash flow 3 months ahead, so you can:
- ‚úÖ Predict cash shortages BEFORE they happen
- ‚úÖ Make confident decisions about spending and hiring
- ‚úÖ Sleep better at night knowing you won't run out of money

---

## Why Cash Flow Forecasting Matters

### The Difference Between Profit and Cash

**Profit** = Revenue - Expenses (on paper)  
**Cash Flow** = Money actually in your bank account

**Example**: You sell R100,000 worth of goods in January. Your costs were R60,000. You made R40,000 profit, right?

**But**:
- Customers pay you in 60 days (March)
- You must pay suppliers in 30 days (February)
- Salaries are due end of January

**Result**: You're R40,000 profitable but have ZERO cash in January and February. You can't pay staff or suppliers. **This is how businesses fail.**

### The SA SMME Reality

South African SMMEs face unique cash flow challenges:

1. **Late Payments**: SA average is 60-90 days (some customers pay 120+ days late)
2. **Load Shedding**: Unexpected costs for generators, solar, lost productivity
3. **Economic Volatility**: Rand fluctuations, inflation (5-7% annually)
4. **High Cost of Credit**: Bank overdrafts cost 15-25% interest
5. **VAT Timing**: You collect VAT from customers but pay it to SARS later (cash trap)

**Without forecasting, you're flying blind.**

## The 3-Month Rolling Forecast Method

### Why 3 Months?

- **1 month**: Too short - doesn't show trends
- **12 months**: Too long - too many unknowns, becomes guesswork
- **3 months**: Just right - actionable, realistic, adjustable

### How It Works

**Month 1**: Based on confirmed orders and commitments (90% accurate)  
**Month 2**: Based on pipeline and trends (70% accurate)  
**Month 3**: Based on assumptions and seasonality (50% accurate)

**Every month**:
1. Compare actual vs forecast (learn from mistakes)
2. Delete the oldest month
3. Add a new Month 3
4. Refine your assumptions

This creates a **rolling forecast** that improves over time.

## Step-by-Step: Building Your First Forecast

### Step 1: Gather Your Data

You'll need:
- ‚úÖ Current bank balance
- ‚úÖ List of customers who owe you money (debtors)
- ‚úÖ List of suppliers you owe money (creditors)
- ‚úÖ Fixed monthly costs (rent, salaries, insurance)
- ‚úÖ Variable costs (stock, transport, marketing)
- ‚úÖ Upcoming large expenses (tax, equipment, licenses)

**Tip**: If you don't have this data, start tracking it NOW. Use a simple Excel sheet or accounting software like Xero, Sage, or QuickBooks.

### Step 2: Open the Forecast Tool

The tool has 4 tabs:
1. **üìà Dashboard**: Your cash flow at a glance
2. **üìñ Instructions**: How to use the tool
3. **‚öôÔ∏è Setup**: Your business details and assumptions
4. **üìä 3-Month Forecast**: The actual forecast

Start with **‚öôÔ∏è Setup**.

### Step 3: Enter Your Setup Details

**Business Name**: Your business name  
**Forecast Start Month**: Today's month (e.g., November 2025)  
**Starting Cash Balance**: What's in your business bank account RIGHT NOW

**Key Assumptions** (be conservative!):
- **Average Monthly Sales**: What you're confident you'll sell
- **Sales Growth Rate**: 5% = 0.05 (monthly growth, if any)
- **% Cash Sales**: How much is paid immediately (vs credit)
- **Average Collection Days**: How long customers take to pay (60-90 days in SA)
- **Cost of Goods Sold %**: If you sell R100, how much did it cost you? (e.g., 50%)
- **Supplier Payment Days**: How long before you pay suppliers (30 days typical)

**Example**:
- You sell R100,000/month
- 30% is cash sales (R30,000 immediate)
- 70% is credit sales (R70,000 paid in 60 days)
- Your costs are 50% (R50,000)
- You pay suppliers in 30 days

### Step 4: Fill in the 3-Month Forecast

Go to **üìä 3-Month Forecast** tab.

**CASH IN (Money Coming In)**:
- **Cash Sales**: Sales paid immediately
- **Collections from Debtors**: Credit sales from 60-90 days ago
- **Loans/Funding**: Any loans or grants you're receiving
- **Other Income**: Rent from property, interest, etc.

**CASH OUT (Money Going Out)**:
- **Suppliers/Stock**: Payments for stock or raw materials
- **Salaries & Wages**: Staff costs (including UIF, PAYE)
- **Rent**: Office, shop, or warehouse rent
- **Utilities**: Electricity, water, internet, phone
- **Transport/Fuel**: Delivery vehicles, travel
- **Marketing**: Ads, social media, promotions
- **Bank Charges**: Transaction fees, card fees
- **Insurance**: Business, vehicle, liability insurance
- **Licenses & Permits**: Annual renewals
- **Loan Repayments**: Monthly loan or overdraft payments
- **VAT Payment**: Bi-monthly VAT to SARS (if registered)
- **Tax**: PAYE, provisional tax, company tax
- **Load Shedding Costs**: Generator fuel, solar maintenance
- **Other Expenses**: Anything else specific to your business

**Tip**: Start with Month 1 (most accurate), then Month 2, then Month 3.

### Step 5: Review Your Dashboard

Go to **üìà Dashboard** tab.

You'll see:
- **Summary table**: Cash In, Cash Out, Net Flow, Closing Balance for each month
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Healthy, ‚ö†Ô∏è Low, or üö® Negative
- **Key Insights**: Which month is tightest, biggest expenses
- **Action Items**: What to do if cash is low or negative

**Red Flags**:
- Any month with negative closing balance
- Closing balance below R10,000 (or 1 month's expenses)
- Cash Out consistently higher than Cash In

---

## Interpreting Your Results

### Scenario 1: All Months Positive, Healthy Balance

**Example**:
- Month 1: R50,000 closing
- Month 2: R60,000 closing
- Month 3: R70,000 closing

**What It Means**: You're in good shape! Cash is growing.

**Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Build an emergency fund (3-6 months' expenses)
- ‚úÖ Consider investing surplus (high-interest savings, growth opportunities)
- ‚úÖ Maintain discipline - don't overspend just because you have cash

### Scenario 2: One or More Months Low (<R10,000)

**Example**:
- Month 1: R30,000 closing
- Month 2: R8,000 closing ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Month 3: R25,000 closing

**What It Means**: Month 2 is tight. A small unexpected expense could cause problems.

**Actions**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chase late-paying customers (focus on Month 2)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Negotiate payment terms with suppliers (ask for 60 days instead of 30)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Delay non-essential spending (marketing, equipment upgrades)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Arrange an overdraft facility BEFORE you need it

### Scenario 3: One or More Months Negative

**Example**:
- Month 1: R20,000 closing
- Month 2: -R15,000 closing üö®
- Month 3: R10,000 closing

**What It Means**: URGENT. You will run out of cash in Month 2.

**Actions**:
- üö® **Immediate**: Arrange short-term funding (overdraft, loan, invoice financing)
- üö® **Cut costs**: Delay all non-essential spending
- üö® **Accelerate collections**: Offer discounts for early payment, chase hard
- üö® **Delay payments**: Communicate with suppliers, ask for extensions
- üö® **Increase sales**: Run a promotion, offer payment plans to customers

**Don't ignore this!** Negative cash flow kills businesses.

## SA-Specific Cash Flow Strategies

### 1. Managing Late Payments

**The Problem**: SA average payment terms are 60-90 days. Some customers pay 120+ days late.

**Solutions**:
- **Offer early payment discounts**: 5% off if paid within 7 days
- **Invoice immediately**: Don't wait until month-end
- **Follow up aggressively**: Call on day 31, 45, 60
- **Use invoice financing**: Companies like Bridgement or Lulalend advance you 80-90% of invoice value
- **Require deposits**: 30-50% upfront for large orders

### 2. Load Shedding Contingency

**The Problem**: Load shedding costs money (generators, lost productivity, spoiled stock).

**Solutions**:
- **Budget R2,000-R10,000/month** for backup power (depending on stage)
- **Solar investment**: Payback period is 3-5 years, then it's free power
- **Adjust operating hours**: Work during daylight, close during peak load shedding
- **Charge customers more**: Build load shedding costs into your pricing

### 3. VAT Cash Flow Management

**The Problem**: You collect VAT from customers but pay it to SARS bi-monthly. It feels like your money, but it's not.

**Solutions**:
- **Separate VAT account**: Move 15% of every sale to a separate account immediately
- **Don't spend VAT**: Treat it as SARS's money, not yours
- **Claim input VAT promptly**: Ensure you claim all VAT on purchases
- **Consider cash accounting**: If turnover <R2.5m, you can pay VAT only when you receive payment

### 4. Seasonal Cash Flow Planning

**The Problem**: Many SA businesses have seasonal peaks (December retail, January tourism, April tax season).

**Solutions**:
- **Build cash reserves in good months**: Save 20-30% of surplus
- **Negotiate flexible supplier terms**: Pay more in good months, less in bad months
- **Diversify revenue**: Add off-season products or services
- **Plan large expenses for good months**: Don't buy equipment in your slow season

### 5. Currency Fluctuations (Importers/Exporters)

**The Problem**: Rand volatility affects costs (importers) or revenue (exporters).

**Solutions**:
- **Hedge currency risk**: Use forward contracts to lock in exchange rates
- **Price in rands**: If possible, avoid pricing in USD/EUR
- **Build in buffer**: Add 10-15% to quotes to absorb currency swings
- **Review pricing monthly**: Adjust if rand moves significantly

## Common Cash Flow Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Being Too Optimistic

**Example**: "I'll definitely sell R200,000 this month!"

**Reality**: You sell R120,000. Now you can't pay suppliers.

**Solution**: **Conservative forecasting**. Use your lowest sales month from last year as the baseline.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Irregular Expenses

**Example**: You forecast monthly costs perfectly, then get hit with R15,000 annual insurance renewal.

**Solution**: **Annualize irregular costs**. Insurance R15,000/year = R1,250/month. Budget this monthly.

**Irregular expenses to remember**:
- Insurance (annual)
- Licenses and permits (annual)
- Company tax (bi-annual)
- Equipment maintenance (quarterly)
- Accounting/audit fees (annual)

### Mistake 3: Mixing Business and Personal Cash

**Example**: You take R10,000 from the business account for personal use. Forecast doesn't account for it. Cash runs out.

**Solution**: **Pay yourself a salary**. Fixed amount, every month, included in forecast.

### Mistake 4: Not Updating the Forecast

**Example**: You create a forecast in January. It's now June. You're still using January's numbers.

**Solution**: **Monthly review ritual**. Last day of every month:
1. Compare actual vs forecast
2. Delete oldest month
3. Add new Month 3
4. Adjust assumptions

### Mistake 5: Ignoring the Forecast

**Example**: Forecast shows Month 2 will be negative. You ignore it. Month 2 arrives. You can't pay salaries.

**Solution**: **Forecasts are warnings, not predictions**. If it shows a problem, ACT NOW to fix it.

## Advanced Cash Flow Strategies

### 1. Cash Flow Forecasting by Week

For very tight cash situations, forecast weekly instead of monthly.

**When to use**:
- You're close to running out of cash
- You have large, irregular payments
- You're in a turnaround situation

**How**: Same method, but break each month into 4 weeks.

### 2. Scenario Planning

Create 3 forecasts:
- **Best case**: Sales 20% higher than expected
- **Base case**: Your realistic forecast
- **Worst case**: Sales 20% lower than expected

**Use**: Helps you plan for uncertainty. If worst case is negative, you MUST take action now.

### 3. Cash Conversion Cycle

**Formula**: Days Inventory + Days Receivable - Days Payable

**Example**:
- You hold stock for 30 days
- Customers pay in 60 days
- You pay suppliers in 30 days
- **Cash Conversion Cycle**: 30 + 60 - 30 = 60 days

**What it means**: You're funding 60 days of operations. The lower this number, the better your cash flow.

**Improve it**:
- Reduce inventory (order more frequently, just-in-time)
- Collect faster (chase debtors, early payment discounts)
- Pay slower (negotiate longer terms with suppliers)

### 4. Working Capital Management

**Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

**Current Assets**: Cash, debtors, inventory  
**Current Liabilities**: Creditors, overdraft, short-term loans

**Healthy ratio**: 1.5 to 2.0 (R1.50-R2.00 in assets for every R1.00 in liabilities)

**If ratio is low (<1.2)**: You're at risk. Focus on building cash reserves.
