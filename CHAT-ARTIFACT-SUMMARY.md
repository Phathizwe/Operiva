## ðŸŽ¯ The CHAT Framework

### **What is CHAT?**
CHAT is a business model visualization tool based on **Activity Theory**, developed by researchers Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and EngestrÃ¶m. It provides a more narrative-driven, relationship-focused alternative to the Business Model Canvas.

### **The 7 Components:**

| Component | Core Question | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **1. Subject** | Who are you? | Your business, team, values, and mission |
| **2. Object** | What do you have? | Assets and resources you buy/acquire |
| **3. Outcome** | What do you produce? | Final product or service delivered |
| **4. Differentiator** | What makes you unique? | Your "secret sauce" and niche |
| **5. Barriers to Entry** | What protects you? | Competitive advantages |
| **6. Customer** | Who do you serve? | User, payer, and community |
| **7. Key Activities** | How do you do it? | Division of labor and core tasks |

### **Visual Structure:**
The framework is visualized as a triangle diagram showing how all 7 components interconnect to tell your business story.
