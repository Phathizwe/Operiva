## Known Issues & Next Steps

### üî¥ Critical: Firestore Security Rules
**Problem**: The site is deployed but may not load data properly because Firestore security rules haven't been deployed (service account lacks permissions).

**Solution**: Manually deploy security rules via Firebase Console:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/operiva/firestore/rules
2. Replace existing rules with content from `firestore.rules`
3. Publish the rules

**Storage Rules**:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/operiva/storage/rules
2. Replace existing rules with content from `storage.rules`
3. Publish the rules

### üü° Optional Improvements

**1. Preview Images**
- Create preview images for 2 new artifacts
- Upload to Firebase Storage or CDN
- Update seed.js with URLs

**2. Custom Domain**
- Set up custom domain (e.g., operiva.co.za)
- Configure DNS records
- Enable SSL certificate

**3. Analytics**
